## Chapter 2: Investigating churn patterns
Youâ€™ll continue leveraging the Excel knowledge you gained from the prerequisite courses to investigate further why customers are leaving Databel.

## Assignments
### 2.1 - Analyzing demographics
- In this exercise, you are tasked with analyzing the different demographic fields from the dataset.
- You'll be using your Excel skills to create a new field to analyze the data with and create your first calculated field in a PivotTable.

### 2.2 - Age Groups
- You found a great insight that senior citizens churn more often. This suggests that it might be a good idea to analyze the customer age in general.
- Your job is to create different age bins and make a combo chart visualizing the number of customers per bracket and their respective churn rates.

### 2.3 - Unlimited plan
- Databel has a hypothesis that people who are not on an unlimited data plan are more likely to churn.
- Your task is to investigate how the Unlimited Data Plan influences the churn rate.

### 2.4 - International calls
- The analysis requirement given by Databel includes a request to analyze the relationship between customers' international activity and churn.
- They are curious about the behavior of customers who call internationally, and if paying for an international plan influences their loyalty.

### 2.5 - Contract type
- Databel also wants to improve its customer service since there have been some reported issues.
- Your job is to investigate two important topics related to customers: the contract type, and how many months a person is a customer.

## Key Insights:
- 2.1: Customers that are considered Senior are the most likely segment to churn at almost 40%. This is a really interesting insight and can be used for future projects to tackle reducing churn amongst this age group.
- 2.2: Customers aged between 79-88 only make up a small percentage of our customer base but have the highest churn rate. This might be expected as customers in this age range may pass away, but there may be other factors that are causing our customers to churn.
- 2.3: Customers who consume the lowest amount of data are actually the most likely to churn at almost 35%.
- 2.4: California is the state that has customers on a international plan that has a particularly high percentage of churners. This is important information that can help Databel make a good decision while allocating their budget for the new promotion.
- 2.5: Customers between the 3 and 4 year mark are much more likely to churn on a One Year contract compared a Two Year. Sales and marketing can use this information to provide offers that would get customers to sign up to 2 year deals.
