## Chapter 1: Exploratory analysis
In this first chapter, youâ€™ll start by exploring your new dataset in Excel and gain an initial understanding of why customers are churning.

## Assignments
### 1.1 - Data preparation
- Before you do any analysis, the first step is to ensure that your data is prepared.
- First, we'll verify the data with a simple check - in this exercise you'll put your data in a table formats and then investigate whether there are any duplicate rows in our customer level data.
- In this case study, you'll be working with two different datasets in the following worksheets: Databel - Aggregate and Databel - Customer. 
- For chapter 1 we'll focus on our customer level data before working with aggregate data later in the case study. The aggregate views are based on data in Databel - Customer.

### 1.2 - Calculating churn
- It will be extremely useful to have a measure that calculates churn before deep-diving into the analysis.
- There is a column called Churn Label that indicates "Yes" or "No", but this column isn't the easiest to work with.
- You'll convert this column to a binomial column indicating if the customer churned or not. You need to use that to calculate the churn rate.

### 1.3 - Investigating churn reasons
- The logical next step is to investigate the different reasons why customers churned.
- Your job is to create a column chart listing the different reasons why customers churn.

### 1.4 - Digging deeper into churn categories
- Churn Reasons are grouped together in the Churn Category column.
- It's your job to identify which churn category is accounting for the highest proportion of churn and understand which priority we should tackle first based on the churn reason.

## Key Insights
We know that over 1,750 customers have churned giving an average churn rate of around 27%. The most common reason that we have found for customers churning related to our competitors. More specifically that our competitors are offering better devices and offers. This could raise questions such as "Is Databel competitive enough?". It's a bit too early to draw any general conclusions, especially as we don't have a clear explanation as to why churn rate is relatively high at 27%. There are many more columns we are yet to analyze.
