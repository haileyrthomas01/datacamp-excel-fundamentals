## Chapter 3: Create a Cohesive Story
In the last chapter, youâ€™ll create a dashboard-style sheet and arrange your visuals to present your results to stakeholders in a cohesive story.

## Assignments
### 3.1 - Adding KPIs
- Now that we've created a series of visuals and pivot tables, we need to collate this information to provide the best insights possible to address any key concerns around churn.
- In this exercise, we'll start by preparing our dashboard sheet to display key information such as total customers, number of churned customers and churn rate.

### 3.2 - Adding churn reasons
- Let's add some context into why our customers are churning with a particular focus on customers who churn as a result of our competitors activities.

### 3.3 - Adding demographics
- Now let's provide some context into the demographics of our churned customers to help the business understand what customers we need to prioritize our retention efforts.

### 3.4 - Adding consumption
- We now need to add the finishing touches by including our consumption data.
