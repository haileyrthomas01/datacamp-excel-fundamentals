## Chapter 2: Managing data and applying aggregate functions
In this chapter, you’ll learn how to work with data in a tabular layout. You will cover topics such as creating named ranges, using subtotals to summarize groups of data, and applying data validation rules. Additionally, you’ll learn how to use aggregate functions in Excel to help summarize your data.

## Assignments
### 2.1 - Naming Ranges
- We've reverted our dataset to before we applied our table styles, we'll now add some names to some important ranges within our data.

### 2.2 - Sub Totals
- The management team would like to understand whether there is a significant difference between each country's order to the delivery period.
- In this exercise, we'll use Sub-Totals to work this out.

### 2.3 - Custom Formulas
- Excel allows users to format the data within sheets in many different ways. It even allows us to create our own custom formats if we can't find the type we want from Excels prepared formats. As well as formatting the data, we can also ensure the integrity of the data within columns and rows. This helps when sharing workbooks with others, or when required to enter new data that might be needed into existing columns or rows.

### 2.4 - Summarizing Sales
- In this exercise, we'll start working with aggregate functions and summarize key metrics on our data including the minimum, maximum and average price of our items.

### 2.5 - Calculating Sales and Profit
- Now, we're looking to summarize our total sales and cost to calculate our overall profit and profit margin ratio.
- We'll be using a mix of aggregate function and arithmetic to achieve our desired result! The output will enable Adventure Works to better understand their total profit and profit margin.
