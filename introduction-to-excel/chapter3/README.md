## Chapter 3: Other functions and visualizing data

## Assignments
### 3.1 - Product Profiles
- Data doesn't always come formatted as we require, so here, we'll focus on formatting a new column by applying a function to an existing column.
- Additionally, we'll create a unique identifier that can be used for future analysis.

### 3.2 - Profit Performance
- Date functions can be powerful when preparing and transforming data ready for analysis, so we'll utilize functions such as YEAR() and MONTH() in this exercise.

### 3.3 - Formatting with Functions
- Finally, we'll finish this chapter by applying some rounding functions to format our cells and ensure they are easy to read.

### 3.4 - Visualizing Categories
- The operations team wants to understand which products perform best, so let's visualize average sales across product categories.
- Excel has a variety of options to represent categorical data effectively, so we'll use column or bar charts to convey this information.
- These charts are powerful tools, enabling concise and visually impactful data presentations.

### 3.5 - Parts of a Whole
- The management team wants to explore how their orders vary from country to country and state to state.
- We'll utilize a sunburst chart to visualize sub-categories within a larger category.
- This powerful chart type allows us to visually represent the interconnectedness and proportions of our data clearly and concisely. Sunburst charts are a type of treemap.

### 3.6 - Capturing a Trend
- Visualizing data over time can help find trends in sales performance. To achieve this, we will utilize line charts.
- However, a crucial step will be editing the data source, which we'll explore during the exercise.
- Line charts offer a powerful means to represent trends and fluctuations, providing valuable insights into sales patterns.
