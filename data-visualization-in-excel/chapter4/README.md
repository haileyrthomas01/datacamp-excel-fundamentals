## Chapter 4: Visualizing disaggregated data with PivotCharts
We'll explore PivotTables, PivotCharts, and how to combine them into a dynamic mini-dashboard. Are you ready to unlock the true power of your data? Let's dive in!

## Assignments
### 4.1 - Basic PivotCharts
- Your business colleagues are asking more and more questions, and you're starting to think about setting up a useful dashboard for them. But first, you want to explore the data a bit more on your own.
- PivotCharts are an excellent choice when performing Exploratory Data Analysis on larger datasets. Let's build our first PivotCharts together.

### 4.2 - Exploratory Analysis
- The ease of using PivotCharts has encouraged you to create more top-of-mind charts.
- After visualizing the orders in the previous exercise, you will create two additional visualizations, presenting other important measures such as sales and profit.
- Furthermore, you will also add interactivity to your new charts, bringing you one step closer to a proper dashboard!

### 4.3 - Dashboard
- Now that we have at least three interesting PivotCharts, assembling them into an interactive dashboard should be a piece of cake, right?
- You are just one step away from surprising your business colleagues with a fully-fledged Excel dashboard!

### 4.4 - Printing
- Having prepared a beautiful dashboard, you want to surprise your manager and colleagues and show your work.
- This will require you to print and share it. To print, it will be necessary to change some print settings to enable printing only the desired tab.
