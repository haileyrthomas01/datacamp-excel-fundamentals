## Chapter 2: Advancing to more complex charts
This chapter will explore how to work with dual series and prepare more advanced charts, such as Bullet charts, Waterfall charts, or Scatter plots. Additionally, we will investigate various chart editing options. There's a lot to learn, so let's get started!

## Assignments
### 2.1 - Tracking several measures
- Could looking at only one measure at a time lead us to a wrong conclusion? You decide to investigate Sales and Orders over time and visualize your insights.
- In this exercise, we will make use of Excel's combo charts.

### 2.2 - Bullet Charts
- The management is focusing on 2018 results and has asked you to check which Sub-Categories exceeded their average 2014-2019 sales performance in 2018.
- Ready to apply what you've learned about the bullet charts?

### 2.3 - Waterfall Chart
- This time, the Finance department got inspired, and they are asking you to help them investigate (and visualize!) the overall profit between 2015 and 2018.
- They know that only some quarters were equally successful, but so far, they have yet to be able to visualize this effectively.
- Will you help them out by building a stunning waterfall chart?

### 2.4 - Scatter Plot
- Scatter plots work great when comparing the performance of various categories across two measures plotted along X- and Y-axis.
- An optional third measure can be added, defining the size of the data points on the chart. Could this be the most versatile chart ever?
- In this exercise, we will use it to analyze how the Regions stack up against each other when it comes to sales, profit, and quantity.
