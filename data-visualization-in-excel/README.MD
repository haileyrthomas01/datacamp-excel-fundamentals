# Course 3: Data Visualization in Excel

## Overview
With this course, I learned to solve business problems using various visualizations, from basic bar and line charts to more advanced scatter plots, bullet charts, and waterfalls. Visualizing insights on summarized and disaggregated raw data (with PivotCharts) held no secrets as I progressed through this course. As I went along, I acquired the best data visualization practices and learned how to leverage visual design elements to the advantage of my data insights!
