## Chapter 3: Data visualization
In this chapter, we will improve our skills in selecting chart elements, applying colors, legends, and labels, while also learning how to troubleshoot and customize poorly designed visuals for the benefit of end users.

## Assignments
### 3.1 - Quarterly Sales Evolution
- As an aspiring data visualization expert, you've gotten to train a young analyst from the Finance department on charting techniques.
- Clearly, there is a lot he can learn from you already! Can you salvage his "Quarterly Sales evolution" chart and propose a better alternative?

### 3.2 - Accenting Lines
- Your trainee is impressed with your speedy conversion of his chart to something informative! He is now supplying you with more information, providing a split of sales by State.
- In this exercise, you will bring specific data points to the spotlight by formatting the line chart and its elements!

### 3.3 - Seasonality
- While working on the previous chart, your trainee analyzed the seasonality of sales.
- He's got a strong suspicion that while the start of the year is strong, Q3 and Q4 underperform year over year.
- He came up with another visualization that, unfortunately, needs your attention. Can you find a better way to compare Q3 and Q4 performance year over year visually?

### 3.4 - Colorful Charts
- Your trainee is slowly getting the hang of data visualization.
- He's heard different things about using color, but your perfectionist nature still feels like his most recent chart, visualizing Profit per Sub-Category, can be improved.
