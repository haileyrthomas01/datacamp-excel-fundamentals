## Chapter 3: What-if analysis
You’ll master the art of scenario analysis using Excel’s built-in What-If Analysis tool. You’ll understand how different variables can impact your sales, perform sensitivity analysis and use it to make informed predictions to stay ahead in dynamic business environments.

## Assignments
### 3.1 - Manual scenario creation
- Scenario analysis helps develop strategies and set targets. For example, in the previous chapter, we calculated the Current Upsell $, which gave us a total amount that could be earned if Bananas got every active non-paying user to upgrade their account.
- While that number was insightful, it's still quite unrealistic - how would Bananas get 100% of customers to upgrade? We can play around with the numbers with scenario analysis to see how much we think this is a more realistic sales opportunity.

### 3.2 - Using Goal Seek
- Sometimes, we know the end goal but are unsure how to get there. We know the last month's Sales Amount was about $80,000.
- Let's say Bananas's sales team aims to earn $100,000 in monthly sales revenue. Which growth rate do they need to achieve?
- We could calculate this ourselves or use Goal Seek!

### 3.3 - What-if analysis with Scenario Manager
- Bananas also wants to explore increasing sales revenue by increasing prices, and they want to see how the projected sales would change in a specific scenario for each Subscription Type.
- It can be tedious to manage and evaluate a bunch of different scenarios. Thats where the Scenario Manager shines, and its a great tool for organizing various scenarios, and even creating summaries of the results.

### 3.4 - Sensitivity analysis with Data Tables
- Data Tables are a great tool for What-If analysis. Similar to the Scenario Summary, they create a table with the results of the inputs; however, it does this in a much easier way.
- Bananas wants to keep exploring their pricing strategy, and they're curious about how Premium sales would be impacted at various levels of prices and demand. The Data Table is the perfect tool for this.
