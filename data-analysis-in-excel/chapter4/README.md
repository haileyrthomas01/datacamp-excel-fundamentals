## Chapter 4: Forecasting
You will unlock the power of forecasting to anticipate future trends and visualize this data for your stakeholders. Youâ€™ll leverage moving averages and trendlines to communicate your findings.

## Assignments
### 4.1 - Moving averages
- The leadership team at Bananas is goal planning for next month, and they're curious about what sales might be. They want us to forecast this for them using historical data.
- There are many different forecasting methodologies, so in this exercise, we'll focus on two different forecasts that can be calculated easily in Excel: simple moving average (SMA) and weighted moving average (WMA).

### 4.2 - Trendline forecasts
- Line charts make forecasting easy by offering many trendlines options.
- There are so many options that picking the right one can be difficult. However, understanding how Excel calculates these will make it easier.
- You will explore some of the trendline options and pick one that fits your data the best.

### 4.3 - Forecast sheet
- In the previous method, the trendlines didn't give us an output with numbers, only a graphic representation.
- While this is nice, having a worksheet with actual numbers can be better.
- Bananas would like actual numbers for a forecast that uses a sophisticated methodology and can consider seasonality and confidence levels.
