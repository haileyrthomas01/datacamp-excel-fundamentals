## Chapter 3: Conditional Formulas
In this chapter, youâ€™ll learn how to use logical functions to create conditional formulas for new flags and filters for your data. You will combine the logical operators to create nested formulas, specifically using the IF function to create new category data. Additionally, you will understand how to differentiate between notes and comments in Excel and use them effectively to share information with others.

## Assignments
### 3.1 - Not to Be
- As you continue your first project at DataCo, you realize that the dataset would benefit from some flags that can be used to filter the data.
- DataCo sells over 50 different products, all at different prices. You, therefore, want to add a flag that can be used to identify expensive items. (Use AVERAGE(), and NOT())

### 3.2 - Functions Two by Two
- Getting products to customers on time is very important for DataCo, especially for customers who pay extra for "Same Day" delivery.
- The Orders sheet has a column called Shipping Mode that contains the different delivery modes for each order - including "Same Day" deliveries.
- You want to add a new category to the data to indicate if priority orders arrive on time. (Use nested IF(AND()))
  
### 3.3 - Well Nested If
- As the data provided by DataCo covers different business areas, like Sales and Finance, they have also provided some key notes from each department along with the instructions.
- You notice that the Finance department must handle any cash payment of $200 or more differently. (Use nested IF(AND()))

### 3.4 - Providing Feedback
- Your DataCo colleagues and managers will be excited to see your work so far, so you will have to share your file at some point.
- To help others understand what you have done, add some notes and comments to explain and discuss your work. (Add notes or comments)
